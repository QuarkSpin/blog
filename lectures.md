How to be Human in the Age of the Machine
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Hannah Fry
{: .book-author}

You are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determined your fate—a human or an algorithm?
An algorithm is more consistent and less prone to error of judgement. Yet a human can look you in the eye before passing sentence.

Welcome to the age of the algorithm, the story of a not-too-distant future where machines rule supreme, making important decisions—in healthcare, transport, finance, security, what we watch, where we go even who we send to prison. So how much should we rely on them? What kind of future do we want?

Hannah Fry takes us on a tour of the good, the bad and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us. In Hello World she lifts the lid on their inner workings, demonstrates their power, exposes their limitations, and examines whether they really are an improvement on the humans they are replacing.

**Mon avis** : 🟢 Une excellente introduction à l’utilisation et la place de l’intelligence artificielle dans nos sociétés modernes, présentant à la fois les risques et les bénéfices de cette technologie. Écrit d’une manière très accessible. À lire absolument !

Marx et Spinoza
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Frédéric Lordon
{: .book-author}

Comment un certain désir s’y prend-il pour impliquer des puissances tierces dans ses entreprises ? C’est le problème de ce qu’on appellera en toute généralité le patronat, conçu comme un rapport social d’enrôlement. Marx a presque tout dit des structures sociales de la forme capitaliste du patronat et de l’enrôlement salarial. Moins de la diversité des régimes d’affects qui pouvaient s’y couler. Car le capital a fait du chemin depuis les affects tristes de la coercition brute. Et le voilà maintenant qui voudrait des salariés contents, c’est-à-dire qui désireraient conformément à son désir à lui. Pour mieux convertir en travail la force de travail il s’en prend donc désormais aux désirs et aux affects. L’enrôlement des puissances salariales entre dans un nouveau régime et le capitalisme expérimente un nouvel art de faire marcher les salariés.

Compléter le structuralisme marxien des rapports par une anthropologie spinoziste de la puissance et des passions offre alors l’occasion de reprendre à nouveaux frais les notions d’aliénation, d’exploitation et de domination que le capitalisme voudrait dissoudre dans les consentements du salariat joyeux. Et peut-être de prendre une autre perspective sur la possibilité de son dépassement.

**Mon avis** : 🟠 Intéressante analyse du système capitaliste moderne sous l'angle des conflits et de la manipulation des désirs. Malheursement écrit dans un style complexe, avec du jargon, des locutions latines et de longues phrases, ce qui rend la lecture parfois très difficile.

From AI to Zombies
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Eliezer Yudkowsky
{: .book-author}

What does it actually mean to be rational? Not Hollywood-style “rational,” where you forsake all human feeling to embrace Cold Hard Logic. Real rationality, of the sort studied by psychologists, social scientists, and mathematicians. The kind of rationality where you make good decisions, even when it’s hard; where you reason well, even in the face of massive uncertainty; where you recognize and make full use of your fuzzy intuitions and emotions, rather than trying to discard them.

In “Rationality: From AI to Zombies,” Eliezer Yudkowsky explains the science underlying human irrationality with a mix of fables, argumentative essays, and personal vignettes. These eye-opening accounts of how the mind works (and how, all too often, it doesn’t!) are then put to the test through some genuinely difficult puzzles: computer scientists’ debates about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), physicists’ debates about the relationship between the quantum and classical worlds, philosophers’ debates about the metaphysics of zombies and the nature of morality, and many more. In the process, “Rationality: From AI to Zombies” delves into the human significance of correct reasoning more deeply than you’ll find in any conventional textbook on cognitive science or philosophy of mind.

A decision theorist and researcher at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, Yudkowsky published earlier drafts of his writings to the websites Overcoming Bias and Less Wrong. “Rationality: From AI to Zombies” compiles six volumes of Yudkowsky’s essays into a single electronic tome. Collectively, these sequences of linked essays serve as a rich and lively introduction to the science—and the art—of human rationality.

In Which I Explain How An Ancient, Ambiguous, and Diverse Book Leads Us to Wisdom Rather Than Answers—and Why That’s Great News
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Peter Enns
{: .book-author}

Controversial evangelical Bible scholar, popular blogger and podcast host of *The Bible for Normal People*, and author of *The Bible Tells Me So* and *The Sin of Certainty* explains that the Bible is not an instruction manual or rule book but a powerful learning tool that nurtures our spiritual growth by refusing to provide us with easy answers but instead forces us to acquire wisdom.

For many Christians, the Bible is a how-to manual filled with literal truths about belief that must be strictly followed. But the Bible is not static, Peter Enns argues. It does not hold easy answers to the perplexing questions and issues that confront us in our daily lives. Rather, the Bible is a dynamic instrument for study that not only offers an abundance of insights but provokes us to find our own answers to spiritual questions, cultivating God’s wisdom within us.

“The Bible becomes a confusing mess when we expect it to function as a rulebook for faith. But when we allow the Bible to determine our expectations, we see that Wisdom, not answers, is the Bible’s true subject matter,” writes Enns. This distinction, he points out, is important because when we come to the Bible expecting it to be a textbook intended by God to give us unwavering certainty about our faith, we are actually creating problems for ourselves. The Bible, in other words, really isn’t the problem; having the wrong expectation is what interferes with our reading.

Rather than considering the Bible as an ancient book weighed down with problems, flaws, and contradictions that must be defended by modern readers, Enns offers a vision of the holy scriptures as an inspired and empowering resource to help us better understand how to live as a person of faith today.

How the Bible Actually Works makes clear that there is no one right way to read the Bible. Moving us beyond the damaging idea that “being right” is the most important measure of faith, Enns’s freeing approach to Bible study helps us to instead focus on pursuing enlightenment and building our relationship with God—which is exactly what the Bible was designed to do.

Why Defending Scripture Has Made Us Unable to Read It
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Peter Enns
{: .book-author}

The controversial Bible scholar and author of *The Evolution of Adam* recounts his transformative spiritual journey in which he discovered a new, more honest way to love and appreciate God’s Word.

Trained as an evangelical Bible scholar, Peter Enns loved the Scriptures and shared his devotion, teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary. But the further he studied the Bible, the more he found himself confronted by questions that could neither be answered within the rigid framework of his religious instruction or accepted among the conservative evangelical community.

Rejecting the increasingly complicated intellectual games used by conservative Christians to “protect” the Bible, Enns was conflicted. *Is this what God really requires?* *How could God’s plan for divine inspiration mean ignoring what is really written in the Bible?* These questions eventually cost Enns his job—but they also opened a new spiritual path for him to follow.

*The Bible Tells Me So* chronicles Enns’s spiritual odyssey, how he came to see beyond restrictive doctrine and learned to embrace God’s Word as it is actually written. As he explores questions progressive evangelical readers of Scripture commonly face yet fear voicing, Enns reveals that they are the very questions that God wants us to consider—the essence of our spiritual study.

A Guide to the Most Controversial, Misunderstood, and Abused Book of the Bible
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Peter Enns, Jared Byas
{: .book-author}

Given the fever-pitched controversies about evolution, Adam and Eve, and scientific evidence for the Flood, the average person might feel intimidated by the book of Genesis.

But behind the heady debates is a terrific story—one that anyone can understand, and one that has gripped people for ages. If you are not a Bible scholar but want to be able to read Genesis and understand its big picture, this brief, witty book is the guide you’ve been waiting for. Clear summaries and thought-provoking questions provide direction for personal reflection and group discussion.

Peter Enns, a Biblical Studies professor, and Jared Byas, an Old Testament professor, summarize the book’s key themes and help us see Genesis as an ancient story, one with continued relevance for human experience today.

*Genesis for Normal People* illuminates the characters that fill the book of Genesis, causing us to resonate with their choices and struggles even as we marvel at their distant world. And that’s what you’ll find here-not scientific proof texts or simple moral tales, but a distant world made available, and a story that is often strange, sometimes dangerous, and always filled with rich possibilities.

Moving Beyond Fear-Based Faith
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Benjamin L. Corey
{: .book-author}

GOD IS NOT TO BE FEARED!

Benjamin L. Corey thought he was suffering a crisis of faith. But what he was going through was a spiritual awakening. Corey documents his growing awareness that the version of Christianity he was raised with was built upon a foundation of fear—fear of our sins, fear of hell, fear of God’s judgment, fear of becoming heretical, fear of getting the faith wrong, and much more. But he also knew that God was supposed to deliver us from fear. So how did Christian faith get so intertwined with fear?

Corey realized that fear does not express faith, since Scripture makes clear that love is both God’s nature and God’s mandate to us, and that these are fully incompatible foundations for faith. In the wake of this realization came newfound insights. Corey learned that what he had been taught was a distorted version of Christianity that was not only untrue but caused real spiritual harm.

He also discovered that he wasn’t alone. Many Christians are yearning to return to the root of their faith, to learn how to distinguish between the Christianity that has become a rigid American civil religion and the authentic Christian faith embodied in Jesus and passed on by his disciples. As he recounts his own spiritual journey, Corey offers a powerful and inspiring message of hope for every Christian increasingly frustrated with fear-based Christianity. Do not be discouraged, he assures them. You do not need to give up your faith; you can rediscover the reality of a vibrant Christianity that delivers us from fear and inspires and guides us all today.

🖋️ Bart D. Ehrman
{: .book-author}

The Untold Story of Forgery in the Bible

In *Forged*, leading Bible authority Bart D. Ehrman exposes one of the most unsettling ironies of the early Christian tradition: the use of deception to establish the truth. With the scholarly expertise and provocative claims for which he’s known, Ehrman reveals which texts were forged in the name of Jesus’s disciples and considers how the deceptions of an unnamed few have prevailed for centuries. The untold story of widespread forgery in the ancient world sheds new light on how documents of scandalous origin became part of the Bible we have today.

The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Bart D. Ehrman
{: .book-author}

For almost 1,500 years, the New Testament manuscripts were copied by hand—and mistakes and intentional changes abound in the competing manuscript versions. Religious and biblical scholar Bart Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself are the results of both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes.

In this compelling and fascinating book, Ehrman shows where and why changes were made in our earliest surviving manuscripts, explaining for the first time how the many variations of our cherished biblical stories came to be, and why only certain versions of the stories qualify for publication in the Bibles we read today. Ehrman frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultraconservative views of the Bible.

Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don’t Know About Them)
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Bart D. Ehrman
{: .book-author}

The Human Story Behind the Divine Book

In this *New York Times* bestseller, leading Bible expert Bart Ehrman skillfully demonstrates that the New Testament is riddled with contradictory views about who Jesus was and the significance of his life. Ehrman reveals that many of the books were written in the names of the apostles by Christians living decades later, and that central Christian doctrines were the inventions of still later theologians. Although this has been the standard and widespread view of scholars for two centuries, most people have never learned of it.

*Jesus, Interrupted* is a clear and compelling account of the central challenges we have when attempting to reconstruct the life and meaning of Jesus.

How the World’s Largest Religion Is Seeking a Better Way to Be Christian
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Brian D. Mclaren
{: .book-author}

The Christian story, from Genesis until now, is fundamentally about people on the move—outgrowing old, broken religious systems and embracing new, more redemptive ways of life.

It’s time to move again.

Brian McLaren, a leading voice in contemporary religion, argues that—notwithstanding the dire headlines about the demise of faith and drop in church attendance—Christian faith is not dying. Rather, it is embarking on a once-in-an-era spiritual shift. For millions, the journey has already begun.

Drawing from his work as global activist, pastor, and public theologian, McLaren challenges readers to stop worrying, waiting, and indulging in nostalgia, and instead, to embrace the powerful new understandings that are reshaping the church. In *The Great Spiritual Migration*, he explores three profound shifts that define the change:

Spiritually, growing numbers of Christians are moving away from defining themselves by lists of beliefs and toward a way of life defined by love.

Theologically, believers are increasingly rejecting the image of God as a violent Supreme Being and embracing the image of God as the renewing Spirit at work in our world for the common good.

Missionally, the faithful are identifying less with organized religion and more with organizing religion—spiritual activists dedicated to healing the planet, building peace, overcoming poverty and injustice, and collaborating with other faiths to ensure a better future for all of us.

With his trademark brilliance and compassion, McLaren invites readers to seize the moment and set out on the most significant spiritual pilgrimage of our time: to help Christianity become more Christian.

The Rhetoric of Evangelical Abstinence Campaigns
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Christine Gardner
{: .book-author}

Even though they are immersed in sex-saturated society, millions of teens are pledging to remain virgins until their wedding night. How are evangelical Christians persuading young people to wait until marriage? Christine J. Gardner looks closely at the language of the chastity movement and discovers a savvy campaign that uses sex to “sell” abstinence. Drawing from interviews with evangelical leaders and teenagers, she examines the strategy to shift from a negative “just say no” approach to a positive one: “just say yes” to great sex within marriage.

Making Chastity Sexy sheds new light on an abstinence campaign that has successfully recast a traditionally feminist idea—"my body, my choice"—into a powerful message, but one that Gardner suggests may ultimately reduce evangelicalism’s transformative power. Focusing on the United States, her study also includes a comparative dimension by examining the export of this evangelical agenda to sub-Saharan Africa.

Défense de l’esprit critique
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Nicolas Gauvrit, Sylvain Delouvée
{: .book-author}

L’esprit critique est sur toutes les lèvres. Depuis l’explosion des fake news diffusant sur Internet, des rumeurs trompeuses, des théories du complot poussant certains jeunes sur la voie de la radicalisation, il semble que nous vivions dans un monde parsemé de pièges pour nos cerveaux trop enclins à croire. Des philosophes et des chercheurs tentent de comprendre ce qui nous rend si prompts à adhérer à des idées parfois farfelues, pourquoi notre raison, en général efficace, recèle quelques « bugs », que d’aucuns ne se privent pas d’utiliser. De leur côté et dans le même objectif de défense intellectuelle, des vidéastes, des journalistes, des médiateurs et des enseignants tentent de développer l’hygiène mentale de leurs contemporains par divers moyens. Dans cet ouvrage, les chercheurs exposent certaines failles mentales qui nous rendent vulnérables aux erreurs, tandis que les médiateurs témoignent des pratiques qu’ils ont mises en place pour participer à l’effort pédagogique. Ensemble, ils imaginent une approche critique de l’autodéfense intellectuelle, une collaboration à venir pour un enseignement de l’esprit critique fondé sur les preuves.

Pourquoi les mythes du complot paraissent-ils envahir l’esprit de nos contemporains ? Pourquoi le traitement de la politique tend à se « peopoliser » ? Pourquoi se méfie-t-on de plus en plus des hommes de sciences ? Comment un jeune homme prétendant être le fils de Mickael Jackson et avoir été violé par Nicolas Sarkozy a-t-il pu être interviewé dans les journaux de 20 h ? Comment d’une façon générale, des faits imaginaires, inventés ou parfois franchement mensongers arrivent-ils à se diffuser dans l’espace public, à nous faire croire tout et n’importe quoi, à infléchir les décisions des politiques, bref à façonner une partie du monde dans lequel nous vivons ? N’était-il pas raisonnable d’espérer qu’avec la libre circulation de l’information et l’augmentation généralisée du niveau d’étude, les sociétés démocratiques allaient tendre vers une forme de sagesse collective ? Ce livre propose, en convoquant de nombreux exemples, de répondre à toutes ces questions en montrant comment les conditions de notre vie contemporaine se sont alliées au fonctionnement intime de notre cerveau pour faire de nous des dupes.

Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don’t
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Julia Galef
{: .book-author}

A better way to combat knee-jerk biases and make smarter decisions, from Julia Galef, the acclaimed expert on rational decision-making.

When it comes to what we believe, humans see what they want to see. In other words, we have what Julia Galef calls a “soldier” mindset. From tribalism and wishful thinking, to rationalizing in our personal lives and everything in between, we are driven to defend the ideas we most want to believe—and shoot down those we don’t.

But if we want to get things right more often, argues Galef, we should train ourselves to have a “scout” mindset. Unlike the soldier, a scout’s goal isn’t to defend one side over the other. It’s to go out, survey the territory, and come back with as accurate a map as possible. Regardless of what they hope to be the case, above all, the scout wants to know what’s actually true.

In *The Scout Mindset*, Galef shows that what makes scouts better at getting things right isn’t that they’re smarter or more knowledgeable than everyone else. It’s a handful of emotional skills, habits, and ways of looking at the world—which anyone can learn. With fascinating examples ranging from how to survive being stranded in the middle of the ocean, to how Jeff Bezos avoids overconfidence, to how superforecasters outperform CIA operatives, to Reddit threads and modern partisan politics, Galef explores why our brains deceive us and what we can do to change the way we think.

“A hopeful book about the potential for human progress when we work off facts rather than our inherent biases” — Barack Obama

*Things aren’t as bad as we think. Fact.*

At last, a book that puts all the bad news in perspective—and brings us surprisingly positive data that show the state of the world has in fact improved over the last 50–200 years. Acclaimed by Bill Gates and Barack Obama, named an Observer “best brainy book of the decade”—destined to be a perennial bestseller and non-fiction classic. (let’s make that a fact!)

“Wonderful … a passionate and erudite message that is all more moving because it comes from beyond the grave… His knack for presentation and delight in statistics come across on every page. Who else would choose a chart of ‘guitars per capita’ as a proxy for human progress?” — Financial Times

“One of the most important books I’ve ever read—an indispensable guide to thinking clearly about the world.” — Bill Gates

Sur la route, si vous n’aviez pas le choix, préféreriez-vous sauver un homme ou une femme ? Un sans-abri ou un cadre supérieur ? Deux jeunes filles ou deux mamies ? Accepteriez-vous de vous sacrifier avec vos passagers pour éviter d’écraser des enfants ? Les voitures sans conducteur rouleront bientôt dans nos villes. Pour la première fois dans l’histoire de l’humanité, une machine décidera seule qui sauver, sans que l’humain ait le temps de vérifier sa décision. L’algorithme choisira en fonction des choix moraux que nous lui aurons inculqués. Mais sommes-nous sûrs de notre propre morale ? Comme le montrent les études scientifiques, la valeur que nous accordons psychologiquement à telle ou telle vie diffère en fonction du sexe, de l’âge, de la condition sociale, de l’état de santé de la personne considérée. Nous sommes aussi conditionnés par notre culture. Il n’existe pas de morale universelle. Nous ignorons quelle sera celle des machines.   Qui, de nous ou de la machine, prendra les commandes ?

Paths, Dangers, Strategies

🖋️ Nick Bostrom
{: .book-author}

*Superintelligence* asks the questions: what happens when machines surpass humans in general intelligence? Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful—possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.

But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed Artificial Intelligence, to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?

This profoundly ambitious and original audiobook breaks down a vast track of difficult intellectual terrain. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom’s work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.

How we know what’s really true
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Richard Dawkins
{: .book-author}

Magic takes many forms. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods’ bridge to earth. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality—science.

Packed with inspiring explanations of space, time and evolution, laced with humour and clever thought experiments, *The Magic of Reality* explores a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? What causes tsunamis? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, inspirational detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist too.

Richard Dawkins elucidates the wonders of the natural world to all ages with his inimitable clarity and exuberance in a text that will enlighten and inform for generations to come.

The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Nicholas A. Christakis
{: .book-author}

For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all of our inventions—our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations—we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society.

In Blueprint, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide.

With many vivid examples—including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own—Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness.

In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it’s tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, Blueprint shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies are still shaping our genes today.

Ces microbes qui construisent les plantes, les animaux et les civilisations
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Marc-André Selosse
{: .book-author}

Au fil d’un récit foisonnant d’exemples et plein d’esprit, Marc-André Selosse nous conte une véritable révolution scientifique. Les microbes jouent un rôle en tout point essentiel : tous les organismes vivants, végétaux ou animaux, dépendent intimement de microbes qui contribuent à leur nutrition, leur développement, leur immunité ou même leur comportement. Toujours pris dans un réseau d’interactions microbiennes, ces organismes ne sont donc… jamais seuls.

Détaillant d’abord de nombreuses symbioses qui associent microbes et plantes, Marc-André Selosse explore les propriétés nouvelles qui en émergent et modifient le fonctionnement de chaque partenaire. Il décrypte ensuite les extraordinaires adaptations symbiotiques des animaux, qu’ils soient terrestres ou sous-marins. Il décrit nos propres compagnons microbiens, le microbiote humain, et leurs contributions, omniprésentes et parfois inattendues.

Enfin, il démontre le rôle des symbioses microbiennes au niveau des écosystèmes, de l’évolution de la vie, du climat, et des pratiques culturelles et alimentaires qui ont forgé les civilisations. Destiné à tous les publics, cet ouvrage constitue une mine d’informations pour les naturalistes, les enseignants, les médecins et pharmaciens, les agriculteurs, les amis des animaux et, plus généralement, tous les curieux du vivant.

A l’issue de ce périple dans le monde microbien, le lecteur, émerveillé, ne pourra plus porter le même regard sur notre monde.

Complicated Stuff in Simple Words
{: .book-subtitle}

🖋️ Randall Munroe
{: .book-author}

It’s good to know what the parts of a thing are called, but it’s much more interesting to know what they do. Richard Feynman once said that if you can’t explain something to a first-year student, you don’t really get it. In *Thing Explainer*, Randall Munroe takes a quantum leap past this: he explains things using only drawings and a vocabulary of just our 1,000 (or the ten hundred) most common words.

Many of the things we use every day—like our food-heating radio boxes (“microwaves”), our very tall roads (“bridges”), and our computer rooms (“datacentres”)—are strange to us. So are the other worlds around our sun (the solar system), the big flat rocks we live on (tectonic plates), and even the stuff inside us (cells). Where do these things come from? How do they work? What do they look like if you open them up? And what would happen if we heated them up, cooled them down, pointed them in a different direction, or pressed this button?

In *Thing Explainer*, Munroe gives us the answers to these questions and many, many more. Funny, interesting, and always understandable, this book is for anyone—age 5 to 105—who has ever wondered how things work, and why.
